# Discussion-based-GAN
### Introduction
This repository contains research experiments on Generative Adversarial Networks. 

### Inspiration

These experiments are inspired by observing how a group completes a big project.
In a group, small pieces of work are distributed to different people.
Each individual works on the specific problem given to him/her and comes 
up with some ideas which are then discussed. These small ideas are then compiled
and checked against the desired outcome. 

### Disscussion based GANs vs. Normal GANs

When we have a lot of independent features `teamGAN` might work better than
normal GAN.

### AIM and Working:
The aim is to develop a `teamGAN` which reflects team work.
